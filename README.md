## Game Mechanics and Development

Dungeon Master is a **top-down RPG** inspired by games like Vampire Survivors. Fight off infinite waves of enemies, gain experience, and upgrade your weapons and skills as you progress. Bosses spawn at specific thresholds, and defeating them allows you to advance. The final boss will test your strength and strategy.

Your primary weapon automatically fires in front of you, damaging enemies upon impact. Reduce their HP to zero to eliminate them. Strategize your upgrades and abilities to survive the onslaught!
